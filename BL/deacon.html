<h1>Am I a Deacon?</h1>

<p>A good article can be found on <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/deacons-church.html">Got Questions</a> that may answer this. I am not going to recap that entire article here and suggest you do read that yourself. Instead, I am going to write from my experience.<p>

<p>A few months ago I updated my LinkedIn profile to include "Church Deacon" as one of my jobs. I did so on the basis that I am serving in Bournemouth International Church but am neither a preacher nor elder. Bournemouth International Church, like a lot of churches, does not explicitly title individuals as 'Deacon'. During my five years with Bournemouth International Church I have realised that members all serve in the church. In fact members are called to make a vow of serventhood before the congregation. This, I believe, is the closest thing we have to being a Deacon.</p>

<h2> Through Dirt </h2>

<p>Unlike my other job, Software Engineer, I did not apply for it based upon a job specification. As serving Christians we are depending on God for this 'job specification' and trusting in Him to make the necessary provision. As we are trusting in God, we shouldn't expect this job specification to take the form of a secular one. Thus one could argue that we should not expect to be given the title of 'Deacon' in quite the same way as I am given the title of 'Engineer'.</p>

<p>So if 'Deacon' is not a title, what is it? The article on <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/deacons-church.html">Got Questions</a> gives a good answer to this. It gives the literal meaning as "through the dirt". One of my regular roles is to mop the toilets, so I think by this definition I am qualified! But what did I write on LinkedIn?, I wrote "Facilities" - 'Chief Bog Mopper' didn't seem an appealing title amongst all the other glamorous titles!</p>

<h2>Not just toilet mopping!</h2>

<p>Through my experience as a Christian with autism God has gifted me to look out for others who may have autism or are otherwise more vulnerable. This then leads me to look into safeguarding of 'adults at risk'. The majority of safeguarding awareness is focused around protecting children even though any formal safeguarding policy will also cover 'adults at risk'.</p>

<div class="bible_quote">"Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy." - Proverbs 31:8-9</div>

<p>Other serving members ,'Deacons' if we want to call them that, serve in others areas. Some serving tables during our Sunday fellowship lunch, others serving in worship band, others in vacuum cleaning and maintenance and so on.</p>

<h2>Humility</h2>

In my office, where I work as a Software Engineer, you will find a title sign that reads "Andrew Rogers, Senior Software Engineer". My beloved brother and sisters in <a href="https://www.bicuk.org/">Bournemouth International Church</a> wear no such badges or titles. They serve non-stop with humility, and decent hearts, out of love for God and His people.
