People with Aspergers are not marginalised because of learning difficulties, they are marginalised by teaching difficulties.

People with Aspergers learn very well and with great depth when supported compassionately. People with autism often specialise their learning much earlier in their childhood than children who are not autistic. Career aspirations are often made sooner and this can lead autistic students to desire to learn career related skills in place of the legislated broader curriculum being taught in the average school classroom.

Since moving to Bournemouth I have spent nearly all of my free time encouraging people with Aspergers in their learning.
