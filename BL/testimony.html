<h1>Testimony of an Autistic Christian</h1>

<p>I am Christian and am autistic. I mention my autism because it takes me on a journey that forms such a wonderful part of my testimony. Until 2005 I lived a recluse lifestyle and had little social contact. In 2005 I moved out from my parental home and attempted to socialise. It was thwart with difficulties and challenges as I had to learn to develop social skills and received many setbacks. At that time I found I could retain Chinese friends easier than English friends. God subsequently came into my life through a Chinese lodger who run bible studies in my dining room. I had learned very little Mandarin at that point but did feel the love that emanated from the people in the room. This was such an overwhelming contrast to the evil we see in the world that it became obvious that God was tangibly present through the love they demonstrated. Because I couldn't fully understand Mandarin I persevered for many years in an English church but whilst accepted by a few people, didn't really gel, nor could I feel that tangible presence of God. It was only after my autism diagnosis I realised that God was calling me to be where he called me, the international church like the one that met in my dining room in 2005.</p>

<p>I received my diagnosis due to legal aid provided whilst defending an ASBO, it was the quickest route to a diagnosis. At that time, in 2014, no distinction was made between autism related socialising difficulties and malicious anti-social behaviour. The court did not consider whether my social difficulties were symptoms of autism or malice. In fact the court seemed to be in disarray and did not even serve the complete order. The draft it did produce was unlawful in its demands and therefore was not implemented. What I can be quite confident about is that the accusations were made with malice. These allegations were made after reporting a bullying culture and exploitation of a specific ethnic group of students at a prayer meeting held in the chaplaincy of the abusive institution. A fellow whistle-blower reported similar false and grotesque allegations after he highlighted corruption in this same institution. A war on evil had commenced!</p>

<p>The press coverage was not welcomed at the day of the ASBO hearing, but that quickly changed. The press soon turned to reporting the corruption at the abusive institution. What was labelled a 'noticeboard prayer' by the chaplaincy soon got a 'noticeboard answer'! I learned a very important lesson from this, you can loose a battle and trust in God to win the war!</p>

<p>My small sacrifice is of course eclipsed by the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. This is why this website must be about Him and His commands. I will confess to a short period where I selfishly tried to give a defence to the above mentioned allegations. However, God, by the spirit, brought me back to the place of putting others first. It is not useful to defend particular false allegations when they are so obviously false, and by doing so, one is distracted from the work God calls us to, that is, to love His people. It is the love that Christians have for each other that makes God tangible to those who do not yet know God. It is this love that made God tangible for me.</p>
