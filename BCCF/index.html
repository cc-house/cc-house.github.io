  <h1>Bournemouth Chinese Christian Fellowship</h1>
  Demonstrating God's love together in Bournemouth. We do this by celebrating the new life He has given us as we believe and follow Jesus Christ.
  <h2>We are a Fellowship</h2>
  We are not a building, we are a body of believers with Jesus the head.
  <h2>Prayer Request</h2>
  Please pray for us as we develop this new fellowship.
  <ul>
    <li>Particularly that we effectively equip Chinese students to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ back to China.</li>
    <li>That we are supported by more native Chinese speaking Christian leaders.</li>
    <li>We are guided by the Holy Spirit to grow this fellowship in a God honouring way.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Learning Chinese?</h2>
  We are currently running a Mandarin Christian Worship evening on most Saturday's. Please visit <a href="http://www.bmccf.uk">Bournemouth Mandarin Chinese Christian Fellowship</a> where you can find more information.
